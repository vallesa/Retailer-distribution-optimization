# Retailer-distribution-optimization
Scheduling and routing optimization problem using Xpress.

A small online retailer wants to optimize its distribution operation. At the end of each day, the retailer has a set of orders that must be delivered the next day. The retailer can use a shipping company (e.g., USPS, Fedex, UPS) to deliver the goods. The firm can also contract a delivery truck and plan a route to visit the costumers, or any combination of shipping companies and delivery truck. Each order has a time window in which it can be served. If an order is served using a shipping company, then the third-party shipping company will satisfy the time window requirement. However, if an order is fulfilled using the delivery truck, then the corresponding customer should be visited within its stablished time window.
